sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: I know because when i put in a sorted text file it returned it pretty fast, but when i put in a random file or an reversed file it
returned pretty slowly

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: It was the fastest sorting method with large numbers. worked all the text files relevently equally,
which fits the O(n log n) and the "Omega"(n log n)

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: It finished sorting the random.txt and the sorted.txt relevently equally and also wasnt the fastest when dealing with large numbers
